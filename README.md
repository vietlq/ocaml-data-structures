# OCaml Data Structures

The OCaml implementation of data structures here are based on the book "Purely Functional Data Structures" by Chris Okasaki. The book provides Standard ML & Haskell implementations but OCaml is much more up-to-date and popular than SML, hence I created this repository to provide reference for readers.
